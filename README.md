# Snake-and-Ladder

Problem Statement

Create a snake and ladder application. The application should take as input (from the command line or a file):

    Number of snakes (s) followed by s lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the head and tail positions of the snake.
    Number of ladders (l) followed by l lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the start and end positions of the ladder.
    Number of players (p) followed by p lines each containing a name.

After taking these inputs, you should print all the moves in the form of the current player name followed by a random number between 1 to 6 denoting the die roll and the initial and final position based on the move.
